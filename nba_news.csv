Russell Westbrook,Westbrook (recently signed) is absent from the injury report and is slated to make his Clippers debut Friday against the Kings- Tomer Azarly of ClutchPoints.com reports.,Westbrook will make his first appearance in a Clippers uniform Friday after being bought out by the Jazz following the trade deadline. Coach Tyronn Lue was unwilling to speak about how Westbrook will fit into the Clippers' rotation- so fantasy managers shouldn't rule out Westbrook joining the first unit.

LeBron James,James (foot) will play Thursday against the Warriors- Marc J. Spears of ESPN.com reports.,James was initially considered probable for Thursday's contest as he continues to deal with left foot soreness.

Andrew Wiggins,Wiggins (personal)- who is listed as out for Thursday's game against the Lakers- remains without a timeline to return to the Warriors while he tends to a family matter- Anthony Slater of The Athletic reports.,Wiggins missed the Warriors' final game before the All-Star break Feb. 14 against the Clippers due to the family matter- and head coach Steve Kerr didn't offer many details Thursday about when the forward might be ready to rejoin the team. With the Warriors opening their second-half schedule with a back-to-back set- Wiggins appears safe to rule out for Friday's game against the Rockets in addition to Thursday's contest. Donte DiVincenzo entered the starting five in place of Wiggins on Feb. 14 and should continue to play on the top unit while Wiggins remains away.,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/application/nba/headshots/1903.vresize.280.280.medium.56.png,NEGATIVE,0.979878783,Anthony Slater- Athletic reports- Thursday game- family matter- timeline to return- Wiggins- personal- Lakers- Anthony- Warriors,coach Steve Kerr- head coach Steve- Warriors' final game- All-Star break Feb.- missed the Warriors'- Clippers due- family matter- rejoin the team- details Thursday- offer many details,Wiggins missed the Warriors' final game before the All-Star break . the forward missed the game due to the family matter .,remains without a timeline

Ivica Zubac,Zubac will miss Friday's game against the Kings due to a strained right calf- Andrew Greif of the Los Angeles Times reports.,Zubac will be sidelined for the first time since Dec. 17 with the calf issue- which should open up an opportunity for Mason Plumlee to step into the starting lineup.

Joel Embiid,Embiid is dealing with a non-COVID illness- but he's still expected to play Thursday versus Memphis- Tim Bontemps of ESPN.com reports.,Per Bontemps- Embiid scrimmaged with the team Wednesday- but he didn't participate in Thursday's morning shootaround. As of now- there doesn't appear to be any concern that the MVP candidate will miss the contest- but his production and usage may take a hit. Fantasy managers are encouraged to monitor Embiid's status closely ahead of the 7:30 p.m. ET tip.,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/application/nba/headshots/1906.vresize.280.280.medium.57.png,POSITIVE,0.87500006,Thursday versus Memphis- Tim Bontemps- play Thursday versus- Bontemps of ESPN.com- Embiid is dealing- non-COVID illness- ESPN.com reports- Memphis- Tim- expected to play,Thursday morning shootaround- team Wednesday- participate in Thursday- Embiid scrimmaged- Bontemps- Thursday- monitor Embiid status- Embiid status closely- MVP candidate- Embiid,Embiid scrimmaged with the team but didn't participate in Thursday's shootaround . there doesn',Embiid is dealing with a non-COVID illness
Kyle Lowry,Head coach Erik Spoelstra indicated Thursday that Lowry (knee) would remain out indefinitely- Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports.,Lowry missed six consecutive games heading into the All-Star break- and it appears he'll miss at least a few more contests while dealing with lingering knee pain. Winderman relays that Lowry left Thursday's practice without comment- despite several requests- so the veteran point guard's status moving forward is murky- at best. Gabe Vincent figures to be the primary beneficiary of Lowry's prolonged absence.,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/application/nba/headshots/1362.vresize.280.280.medium.20.png,NEGATIVE,0.998777568,coach Erik Spoelstra- South Florida Sun-Sentinel- Head coach Erik- Florida Sun-Sentinel reports- Thursday that Lowry- Ira Winderman- Spoelstra indicated Thursday- South Florida- knee- remain out indefinitely,lingering knee pain- consecutive games heading- All-Star break- knee pain- missed six consecutive- contests while dealing- dealing with lingering- Lowry left Thursday- Lowry missed- left Thursday practice,lowry missed six consecutive games heading into the All-Star break . he'll miss at least a few more contests while,Lowry (knee) would remain out indefinitely
Robert Williams III,Williams will start Thursday's game versus the Pacers.,Williams will return to the starting lineup for Boston's first game of the second-half schedule. The big man has started only 13 of his 23 appearances this year- averaging 8.8 points- 10.1 rebounds- 2.1 assists and 1.6 steals-plus-blocks in 27.2 minutes during those contests.

Kelly Oubre Jr.,Oubre (hand) is probable for Friday's game against the Timberwolves.,Oubre hasn't played since Dec. 29. He underwent surgery to address a left hand injury Jan. 5 and was struggling to make any progress in rehab. However- the extended time off during the All-Star break was beneficial for the lefty forward. Given the injury wasn't to his lower body- Oubre shouldn't have any conditioning concerns during his expected return- but he may be a bit rusty offensively. With the Hornets close to full strength- he figures to operate as a reserve- but he should still garner significant usage when he's back to full speed.,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/application/nba/headshots/2062.vresize.280.280.medium.46.png,POSITIVE,0.653371394,Oubre- hand- probable for Friday- Friday game- Timberwolves- probable- game,hand injury Jan.- left hand injury- played since Dec.- progress in rehab- underwent surgery- surgery to address- address a left- struggling to make- make any progress- Dec.,the lefty forward hasn't played since Dec. 29 . he underwent surgery to address a left hand injury .,Oubre (hand
Terry Rozier,Rozier (hand) is probable for Friday's game against the Timberwolves.,Rozier was unavailable for the Hornets' final game before the All-Star break due to a right hand sprain- but he'll likely be back in action when the team resumes play Friday.

OG Anunoby,Anunoby (wrist) is available for Thursday's game against the Pelicans- Michael Grange of Sportsnet.ca reports.,Anunoby will return from a sprained left wrist Thursday after nine consecutive absences.

Jamal Murray,Head coach Michael Malone said Murray (knee) will play Thursday against the Cavaliers- Spencer Davies of BasketballNews.com reports.,Murray missed Denver's final six games before the All-Star break due to right knee soreness- and while he deemed himself healthy- he was initially listed as questionable for the Nuggets' first game of the second-half schedule. However- it appears that listing was merely a formality- as his head coach officially cleared the dynamic point guard. Given it'll be Murray's first time suiting up since Feb. 4- he may operate under a minutes restriction- but it's safe to assume he'll garner his usual role in the starting lineup. Before his absence- Murray played extremely well- posting 28.0 points- 7.6 assists- 4.6 rebounds and 1.3 steals while shooting 51.9 percent from the field and 42.9 percent from deep in his last eight appearances.,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/application/nba/headshots/2210.vresize.280.280.medium.31.png,POSITIVE,0.997615933,coach Michael Malone- Head coach Michael- Malone said Murray- Spencer Davies- knee- play Thursday- Davies of BasketballNews.com- BasketballNews.com reports- Murray- Cavaliers,missed Denver final- Murray missed Denver- All-Star break due- knee soreness- deemed himself healthy- second-half schedule- break due- initially listed- listed as questionable- Nuggets' first game,he was initially listed as questionable for the Nuggets' first game of the second-half schedule . but it appears that,Murray
Bobby Portis,Portis (knee) isn't on the injury report for Friday's game against the Heat.,Portis was expected to return to action Friday after participating fully in practice recently- and he's officially been cleared to suit up as the Bucks resume play following the All-Star break.

Giannis Antetokounmpo,Antetokounmpo (wrist) is doubtful for Friday's game versus Miami.,Antetokounmpo was limited during Wednesday's practice and will likely sit out Milwaukee's first game after the All-Star festivities due to a right wrist sprain he suffered in the Bucks' final before the break. The MVP candidate's X-rays came back negative- but despite the encouraging news- it was expected the Bucks might keep Antetokounmpo sidelined for a few games to avoid any potential setbacks. If he's indeed ruled out- Jrue Holiday figures to operate as Milwaukee's primary playmaker- while Joe Ingles- Bobby Portis and Jae Crowder should have clear paths to 20-plus minutes.,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/application/nba/headshots/1851.vresize.280.280.medium.79.png,NEGATIVE,0.98663646,game versus Miami- Friday game versus- Antetokounmpo- wrist- doubtful for Friday- Miami- Friday- doubtful- game- versus,All-Star festivities due- limited during Wednesday- Wednesday practice- Bucks' final- MVP candidate X-rays- wrist sprain- sprain he suffered- Jrue Holiday figures- Milwaukee primary playmaker- Antetokounmpo was limited,Antetokounmpo suffered a right wrist sprain in the Bucks' final before the break . he,Antetokounmpo (wrist) is doubtful

He's had limited minutes off the bench since returning to action in late January and has averaged 15.3 points- 4.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 19.5 minutes per game over his 10 appearances during that time.
